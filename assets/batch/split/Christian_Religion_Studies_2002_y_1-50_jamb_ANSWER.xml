</explanation></answer><answer><canswer>b</canswer><ano>37</ano><explanation> Mark 14
[22] And as they were eating, he took bread,
and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to
them, and said, "Take; this is my body."
[23] And he took a cup, and when he had
given thanks he gave it to them, and
they all drank of it.
[24] And he said to them, "This is my blood
of the covenant, which is poured out
for many.
[25] Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink
again of the fruit of the vine until
that day when I drink it new in the kingdom
of God."
The event occurred on the first day of
Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the
Passover lamb. This was the bread that was
eaten. Verse 12 of the Chapter refers. The
statement “… not drink again of the fruit of
the vine …” points in the direction of the
second emblem.
Note: An emblem is something that is
generally accepted as a symbol of a quality
or idea.

puts in the sickle, because the harvest has
